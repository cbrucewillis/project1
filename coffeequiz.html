<div id="question" >
<p>We all have those days when we need a good cup of joe. But when we get to the coffee shop, what do we want? Do you need a strong cup of something dark? Do you need something sweet at add a little something more to your day? <br>Coffee has its own personality - find out which one you are!</p>

<div id="question" >
<p><strong>1. You find a wallet in a store parking lot. There's $40 in it, a credit card and driver's license. You...</strong></p>
<input type="radio" name="wallet" value="5" />Immediately take it inside to the customer service desk. You'd want someone to do the same for you.<br />
<input type="radio" name="wallet" value="0" />Try to find the person yourself - they might reward you for returning it.<br />
<input type="radio" name="wallet" value="10" />Keep the money and return it to the front desk. It's only $40, they'll be grateful to get the card and ID back. Plus, you probably need it more than they do.<br />
<input type="radio" name="wallet" value="15" />Just keep it. If you don't, someone else will.<br />
<input type="radio" name="wallet" value="20" />Leave it. You don't want to deal with it.<br />
</div>

<div id="question" >
<p><strong>2. At a party you...</strong></p>
<input type="radio" name="party" value="10" />Hang out with a couple of close friends on the couch.<br />
<input type="radio" name="party" value="0" />Talk to everyone. You're pretty much the life of this thing.<br />
<input type="radio" name="party" value="5" />Hit the dance floor. Isn't that the point of a party?<br />
<input type="radio" name="party" value="15" />Drink a few drinks and get out. Parties are pointless.<br />
<input type="radio" name="party" value="20" />Enjoy hanging out, but prefer a quiet evening of relaxation.<br />
</div>

<div id="question" >
<p><strong>3. You have the chance to go on a vacation. Where do you want to go?</strong></p>
<input type="radio" name="vac" value="10" />Someplace you've never been with lots of exploring to do and sights to see.<br />
<input type="radio" name="vac" value="0" />Somewhere relaxing with luxurious amenities.<br />
<input type="radio" name="vac" value="15" />Someplace that's well-priced and or familiar.<br />
<input type="radio" name="vac" value="5" />Somewhere adventurous. Let's climb a mountain!<br />
<input type="radio" name="vac" value="20" />You'd rather stay home and catch up on some well-deserved sleep.<br />
</div>

<div id="question" >
<p><strong>4. Your workplace wants to start a charity softball team. You...</strong></p>
<input type="radio" name="team" value="0" />Sign up immediately. Sounds like fun!<br />
<input type="radio" name="team" value="10" />Have a lot to do already, but will give it a shot as long as it's for charity.<br />
<input type="radio" name="team" value="20" />Don't want to do anything else that requires you to further interact with your coworkers.<br />
<input type="radio" name="team" value="5" />Don't sign up because sports isn't your thing, but will support the team from the sidelines.<br />
<input type="radio" name="team" value="15" />Sign up. Competition is your thing.<br />
</div>

<div id="question" >
<p><strong>5. You have to cook a dish for a family gathering and have no idea where to start. You...</strong></p> 
<input type="radio" name="food" value="5" />Call up your aunt who always has the best recipes. With her help you think you can make something work.<br />
<input type="radio" name="food" value="15" />Make it up as you go. If it doesn't turn out well, it's your family's fault for trusting you with something like this.<br />
<input type="radio" name="food" value="20" />Don't make anything. In fact, maybe it's not worth showing up at all.<br />
<input type="radio" name="food" value="0" />Order something to pick up on the way. It'll please everyone and you don't have to worry about making something edible.<br />
<input type="radio" name="food" value="10" />Try a recipe. Maybe you'll learn something.<br />
